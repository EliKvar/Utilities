In the discussion I often thought about many different situations where there doesn’t seem to be a right answer.
One realistic situation I thought of is the question the Airforce has to answer when there is a hijacked passenger plane.
Does the military jet shoot down the plane killing the citizens on the plane or does the jet let the plane fly into something 
killing more citizens. Obviously there’s more factors but ultimately in this scenario I think they do shoot the plane down.
